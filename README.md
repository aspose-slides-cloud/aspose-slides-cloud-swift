## How to use the SDK?
The complete source code is available in this repository folder.

## Prerequisites
To use Aspose Slides Cloud SDK for Java you need to register an account with [Aspose Cloud](https://www.aspose.cloud/) and lookup/create App Key and SID at [Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps). There is free quota available. For more details, see [Aspose Cloud Pricing](https://purchase.aspose.cloud/pricing).

Minimal supported Swift version is 4.2.3.

### Installation

To use the SDK in a swift package, add a the SDK to dependencies in your Package.swift:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.2.3
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/aspose-slides-cloud/aspose-slides-cloud-swift", from: "20.8.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyPackage"
            dependencies: ["AsposeSlidesCloud"]),
    ]
)
```

To use the SDK as a Cocoapod, add "pod 'AsposeSlidesCloud'" line to your Podfile.

```ruby
target 'myproj' do
  ...
  pod 'AsposeSlidesCloud', '~> 20.2.0'
end
```
### Sample usage

The example code below converts a PowerPoint document to PDF format using AsposeSlidesCloud:
```swift
import Foundation
import AsposeSlidesCloud

let dispatchGroup = DispatchGroup()

AsposeSlidesCloudAPI.appSid = "MyAppSid"
AsposeSlidesCloudAPI.appKey = "MyAppKey"

dispatchGroup.enter()
let input = FileManager.default.contents(atPath: "MyPresentation.ppt")!
let request = postSlidesConvertRequest(format: "pdf", document: input, password: "password", fontsFolder: "")
SlidesAPI.postSlidesConvert(request: request) { (response, e) -> Void in
    do {
        let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: "MyPresentation.pdf")
        try (response as! Data).write(to: url)
    } catch {
        print("Error saving file: \(error).")
    }
    if (e != nil) {
        print("An error occured: \(e).")
    }
    dispatchGroup.leave()
}
dispatchGroup.notify(queue: DispatchQueue.main) {
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)
}
dispatchMain()
```
